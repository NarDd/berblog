I started this site in order to pen down my learning journey in coding. The motivation started when I received my first FAANG interview.

I told myself that it was time to release a blog despite it being under developed and I will continue to improve the blog as I go along. 

Over the next few posts, I will be sharing what I have learnt about data structure and algorithms as well the interview process.
